Chapter 2: Goblin Misadventures. The Burrito Incident
Sabar: Alright team, stay sharp. Goblins may be small, but they're sneaky.
Keiqin: I’m not worried about the goblins, I’m more worried about what Lina had for lunch.
Lina: Hey! That burrito was perfectly safe. Probably. Anyway, we’ve got more important things to focus on.
goblin: Grah! (swings tiny club)
Sabar: Keiqin, stop poking fun and start poking goblins!
Keiqin: On it! swings sword This one’s for the burrito!
goblin: Yelp (dives for cover)
Lina: Really, Keiqin? Anyway, fireball coming up! casts spell
goblin: Grah! (runs around on fire)
Sabar: Nice shot, Lina! Now, let’s not let them regroup.
Keiqin: Why are they always so many? It’s like they have a secret goblin cloning factory somewhere.
Lina: Don’t give them ideas, Keiqin!
goblin: Grah! (charges)
Sabar: Oh great, now there’s a leader. Keiqin, distract him!
Keiqin: You got it! Hey, goblin! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!
goblin: Grah? (confused)
Sabar: Perfect, now Lina, hit it with everything you’ve got!
Lina: With pleasure! casts big fireball
goblin: Boom (knocked out)
Keiqin: That was awesome! High five, team!
Sabar: We make a great team. Now, let’s find that treasure.
Lina: And maybe avoid any future burrito incidents...
Keiqin: I’ll consider it. Maybe. winks
