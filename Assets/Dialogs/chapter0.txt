Chapter 0: isekaicollection 
Sabar: groaning Ugh where are we? And why does the ground feel so fluffy?
Keiqin: poking the ground It’s literally a giant mushroom. We’re standing on a massive mushroom. Cool, I guess?
Lina: rubbing her eyes Wait… did we just... isekai? This feels so... isekai! Pink sky? Giant mushrooms? Weird outfits? Yep, classic!
Sabar: tapping her armor Uh, why am I dressed like I’m going into a jousting tournament? And more importantly... looking at her massive sword... why do I have a sword that’s bigger than me?
Keiqin: swinging her sword around like a pro Oh, hey, I got a cool sword too! Nice. pauses Wait, are we in one of those gacha games? Please tell me we’re not just some rare pulls...
Lina: looking at her staff, unimpressed I knew I shouldn’t have signed that weird mobile game agreement! I just wanted a new wizard skin for my avatar, not this! waves her staff Also, why is my staff glowing? Is this thing gonna explode?
Sabar: eyeing Lina cautiously If it does, point it that way, thanks.
Keiqin: sighs dramatically Okay, okay, focus, ladies. What’s the first rule of getting isekai’d?
Lina: enthusiastically Find the cute animal sidekick!!
Keiqin: Exactly. We need a fluffy, talking mascot who’ll give us a quest or something.
Lina: looking around Maybe it’s hiding in these giant mushrooms. Hey, maybe one of these is the mascot! kicks a mushroom
Sabar: scolding Don’t kick the mushrooms! What if they’re magical or something?
Keiqin: grinning Or worse, what if they’re sentient? Imagine—puts on a deep voice "You’ve kicked the sacred mushroom king! Now suffer the wrath of the Fungus Empire!"
Lina: panicking Wait, can mushrooms have empires?? What’s next, we’ll be fighting broccoli knights??
Sabar: laughing Focus! Let’s just figure out where we are. Maybe there’s a village nearby with actual people who can explain why we’re dressed like cosplayers at an anime convention.
Keiqin: nodding Right. First step in any isekai situation, find civilization, gather information, avoid weird tropes.
Lina: snickers You say that like we’re not already in a weird trope. Look at us! A knight, a swordwielding badass, and a wizard. We are the trope!
Sabar: deadpan Yeah, but at least we’re not the ‘clueless guy who gets an OP power and a harem,’ so there’s that.
Keiqin: grinning Yet.
Lina: glaring at Keiqin Don’t jinx it!
