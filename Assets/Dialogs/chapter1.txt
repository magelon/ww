Chapter 1: The Awakening
Sabar: Alright team, let’s go over the plan one more time. Keiqin, you’ll distract the slime with your dance moves.
Keiqin: My dance moves? Really, Sabar? Can't I just hit it with my sword?
Lina: No, he's right, Keiqin. Your dance moves are legendary. Plus, you keep insisting they’re magical.
Keiqin: Fine, but if I end up covered in slime, you owe me a new cape, Lina.
c: Gloop gloop
Sabar: Focus, guys. I’ll come in from the left and Lina, you zap it with a fireball when it’s distracted.
Lina: Got it. Hey, why does the slime look like it’s enjoying Keiqin’s dance?
c: Gloop gloop (wobbles happily)
Keiqin: I think it’s copying me! Look, it’s doing the moonwalk!
Sabar: Alright, here’s my chance. Charging in now!
c: Gloooooop (envelops Sabar)
Sabar: Help! It’s got me!
Lina: Keiqin, I thought you were supposed to distract it?
Keiqin: I did! It’s not my fault it likes my moves. Lina, zap it, now!
Lina: Fireball coming up! zap
c: Sizzle (shrinks and releases Sabar)
Sabar: Whew, thanks Lina. And Keiqin… maybe save the dancing for the victory celebration next time.
Keiqin: You’re just jealous because the slime didn’t like your plan.
Lina: Let’s just get out of here before Sabar gets another bright idea.
Sabar: Hey, my ideas are awesome! Sometimes.
Keiqin: Well, at least we have a new dance move for the celebration! starts dancing
Lina: Oh brother. rolls eyes but joins in anyway
