Chapter 1: The Awakening
Scene: A dense forest with towering trees and a mystical glow. keiqin wakes up on the forest floor, disoriented.
keiqin: (rubbing their head) Where am I? This doesn’t look like the park…
sabar: (approaching with caution) Halt! Who goes there?
keiqin: (startled) Whoa, easy! I’m just… lost. I don’t even know how I got here.
sabar: (lowering his sword) You don’t seem to be a threat. My name is sabar, knight of the Kingdom of Eldoria. And you are?
keiqin: I’m keiqin. I was just in my world a moment ago, and now I’m here. This must be a dream…
lina: (appearing from behind a tree) It is no dream, young one. You have been summoned to our realm for a reason.
keiqin: (confused) Summoned? By who? And why?
lina: (smiling gently) By the ancient magic of Eldoria. There is a prophecy that speaks of a hero from another world who will save us from the impending darkness.
sabar: (nodding) We believe you are that hero, keiqin. The Dark Lord’s forces are growing stronger, and we need your help to defeat them.
keiqin: (taking a deep breath) This is a lot to take in. But if what you’re saying is true, then I guess I don’t have much of a choice. What do I need to do?
lina: (handing keiqin a glowing amulet) This amulet will guide you. It holds the power of the ancient spirits. You must seek out the four elemental crystals scattered across Eldoria. Only then can we hope to stand against the Dark Lord.
sabar: (placing a hand on keiqin’s shoulder) Fear not, keiqin. You will not face this journey alone. We will be by your side every step of the way.
keiqin: (determined) Alright then. Let’s do this. For Eldoria!
