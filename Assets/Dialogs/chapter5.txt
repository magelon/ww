Chapter 5: The Golem's Lair
Sabar: "Stay close. This cave is known to be the lair of a powerful golem. We need to be ready for anything."
Keiqin: "I've heard stories about golems. They're tough as stone and don't have a sense of humor. Not even a little."
Lina: "Focus, Keiqin. This isn't the time for jokes."
Golem: "Who dares enter my domain?"
Sabar: "That would be us. Prepare yourselves!"
Keiqin: "Great, another friendly welcome. Lina, got any spells for turning rocks into pebbles?"
Lina: "I’ll do my best. Just keep it distracted."
Keiqin: dashed forward, drawing the golem’s attention. He swung his sword, but it barely left a scratch on the golem's sturdy exterior.
Golem: "Foolish mortals. You cannot harm me!"
Lina: "Sabar, we need to find its weak point!
Sabar: "Agreed. Keiqin, try to find any cracks in its armor. Lina, keep those spells coming!"
Keiqin: "It’s like hitting a mountain! Sabar, any ideas?"
Sabar: examined the golem carefully, noticing a faint glow emanating from its chest.
Sabar: "Its chest! That’s where its core is. Aim for that!"
Lina: focused her magic on the glowing spot, channeling all her energy into a powerful blast.
Lina: "Take this, you overgrown boulder!"
Sabar: "Well done, team. Another victory for the books."
Keiqin: "And I didn’t even get squashed! Let’s see if there’s any treasure hidden in this cave."
Lina: "Just be careful. We don't want another surprise like that."
